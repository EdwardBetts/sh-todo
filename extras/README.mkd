# Purpose of the `/extras` directory

This directory holds scripts which may have any combination of the following 
properties: experimental, reliant on non-POSIX tools or languages, or 
implementing a feature that is unlikely to be widely useful.

`todone-view` will print a formatted list of completed tasks in 
reverse-chronological order, with a different section for each day.
